This is a simple Python program that calculates the total marks, average marks, and grade for a student based on their marks in five subjects.



\*\* How It Works



The program asks the user to input the marks obtained in 5 different subjects. Then, it calculates:



\- The total marks by adding the marks of all subjects.

\- The average marks by dividing the total by 5.



Based on the average marks, it assigns a grade:



\- A if the average is 90 or above.

\- B if the average is 75 or above.

\- C if the average is 50 or above.

\- F if the average is below 50.



\*\* How to Use



1\. Run the program.

2\. Enter the marks for each of the five subjects when prompted.

3\. See the total marks, average marks, and the grade displayed on the screen.
